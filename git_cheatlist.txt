# Basic git workflow:

 -> Always check whether there is some new/modified file from the repository:

    git pull


 -> To sand a new/modified file for the repository:
    1) git add [file_name] 
    2) git commit -m ["short message"]
    3) git push
   
    Â· Note: we can add many files before including an unique commit message. 


 -> Check the files that we add:
    
    git status
